# hashing-fun
Playing around with hashing algorithms and setting up a sym table and comparing hashing lookup to array lookup speed on the same 1,000,000 keys

Need to refactor as this is all over the place.
To run as is have *.py and keys.txt in one directory and run 'python driver.py' from mentioned directory.
